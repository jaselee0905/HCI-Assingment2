# Analysis

The top 5 features that aren't seen on any app currently is the ability to be able to see grades directly on the app without having to open a new browser. Another features thats missing but wanted, it the ability to update your schedules through the mobile app. Classroom navigation is another feature that is missing from all these apps, and I believe its important for schools with so many different buildings and rooms. Currently with many apps and current systems at school making an appointment with a councilor or the office requires a seperate app, I believe that this feature should be included on the main school app. I think the last missing feature should be some way for students to be able to interact with each other, like a forum so that school clubs and communities can promote themselves and also inform other students about upcoming events, seperates from official school updates.
